This is preliminary version of lightweight munin plugin for monitoring of transmission bittorrent client throughoutput and torrent count. Currently only netrc auth is supported.

TODO:
- Set up proper licensing lines (???) GPLv3????
- Add user/password authorization support;
- Allow setup without specifying hostname. Use localhost in such cases; [done]
- Switch to bash and bash arrays for proper handling of special characters (e.g. spaces) in user/password/netrc file path; [done]
- Write documetation for munin-doc;
- Write nice README.md;
- Switch to parsing strings with bash regular expressions and other embedded features to drop sed dependency.
- Allow auto config. Check if there is available transmission rpc on localhost:9091.
